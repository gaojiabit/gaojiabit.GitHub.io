# vector
1. defination
    - vector is a geometric object has magnitude(or length) and direction.
	- In classical Euclidean geometry，A Euclidean vector is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude.
	- 在经典欧几里得几何中，向量是具有相同大小的有向线段的等价类。
	- In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from linear algebra. 现代几何通过线性代数的方式定义欧式空间。欧式空间是一个实数域上的一个有限维的內积空间。满足加法交换的群。
	- In the Cartesian coordinate system, a bound vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point.a free vector may be thought of in terms of a corresponding bound vector, in this sense, whose initial point has the coordinates of the origin 
	- 在笛卡尔坐标系中，一个有界向量可以通过它的起始点确定。一个自由向量被确定其起点为坐标系的原点。
	- 向量就是有方向和大小的量。
2. Basic properties
	- Equality
	- Opposite ,parallel, and antiparallel vectors
	- Addition and subtraction
	- Scalar multiplication
	- Length
	- Unit vector
	- Zero vector
	- Dot product
	- Cross product
	- Scalar triple product
	- Conversion between multiple Cartesian bases
	- Perpendicular,projection
